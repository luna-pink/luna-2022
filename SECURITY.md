## Reporting a Vulnerability

How to go about reporting security vulnerabilities and bugs.

To report a bug, create a new issue and describe the feature you were using the expected behiviour and the behaviour you observed.
Additionally if possible please specify steps to recreate the issue. You can expect a reply on security issues within 48 hours of issuing the report,
if the vulnerability is accepted work will begin shortly after. If the vulnerability is dismissed/declined the issue will be closed.
You may re-open an issue if you discover more broken functionality that could further make the issue exploitable.
